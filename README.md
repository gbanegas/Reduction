# Reduction

Code of the master thesis of Gustavo Banegas

# What is? 
It is an algorithm to calculate the number of XORs required for polynomial modular reduction using irreducible polynomials. 

The number of XORs is per bit. The implementation is a form to find another irreducible polynomial give a group of irreducible polynomials.
