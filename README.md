# Reduction

## Introduction
The project idea is an algorithm to determine the number of XORs performed in the polynomial modular reduction. 

## Usage
It is possible to use the program. It is possible to use one single thread or multiples threads. 

### Single Thread
To use the single thread the usage is:
<pre><code>python single.py -i inputfile -o outputfile</code></pre>

### Multiple Threads
